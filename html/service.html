    <h3>Breakaway Ministries</h3>
    <p>
        Breakaway is a bible study that takes place inside of Texas A&M University's Reed Arena every Tuesday night at 9pm during Spring and Fall semesters. 
        Their mission is "to help any and every college student take either their first or next step with Jesus Christ." At the end of my Fall semester of 2022, I was interviewed and accepted onto Breakaway's Roadie Team. 
        I began serving at the beginning of the next semester. The Roadies are responsible for setting up the stage, including lights and speakers. On a typical Tuesday, we will arrive around 5 pm to unload trailers. 
        Once everything is unloaded, we start building the stage. At this point we split into sub teams to complete different parts of the stage. I help set up the speakers at the front of the stage. 
        Next, I help around other teams where needed before the teams group back up to put up the back curtains. Once setup is done, we go out for dinner as a team. Next, we gather before the service to encourage and pray for one another. 
        One sermon later, we disassemble the stage and load everything back onto the trailers. When searching for a place to volunteer, Breakaway was one of my top choices. 
        For one, I have attended Breakaway since my second college semester, and I figured that if I am there so often, I may as well be helping out. 
        And it is very much a privilege to serve this ministry that has been so instrumental to growing my faith by helping create a space where people can come to break free from the chaos of life for a bit and learn about God.
